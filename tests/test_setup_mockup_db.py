# File: test_setup-mockup-db.py
# Date: 3/18/2019
# Description: a file to test the mockup database setup script (by seeing if the everything in the database
#              was setup correctly). Note: information from stack overflow posts were used. I also based
#              some bits of my code off the code on some of the posts and might have transcribed snippets of
#              some of the code I saw (from the posts), but I don't think I did anything that should
#              cause copyright problems)
